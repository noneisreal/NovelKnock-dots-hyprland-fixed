# Fixed "NovelKnock" Dotfiles (Hyprland Edition)

A repaired & repurposed version of [end-4's](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) dotfiles, 
with minor (and major) tweaks to actually boot and behave nicely.

Tested on EndeavourOS with Hyprland in a VM and bare metal.

## Why?

Because the original configs look gorgeous but are half-broken, and I'm a fan of both aesthetics and sanity.  
So I fixed the NovelKnock.

## Features

- Hyprland, Eww, Waybar, Rofi, etc.
- Fixed paths, removed hardcoded junk
- Added compatibility with non-end-4 users (aka humans)

## Credits

- Huge thanks to end-4 for the original inspiration and visual magic.
- Praise be to Jesus for the strength to fix it :))

## Update
- Maybe i will convert the eww to quickshell, i can't fix that :((
- Update.v2 i fixed something and just missing format and icons
- Update: i temporary pushed like this, don't use, it still not working
